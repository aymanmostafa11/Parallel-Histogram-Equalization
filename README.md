# Parallel-Histogram-Equalization
 Histogram equalization is a technique for adjusting image intensities to enhance contrast in input image, using **MPI** Parallel Programming
 
 In gray images, each pixel has only one value which is the
intensity of the pixels. The value may range from 0 to 255. The values are varying from
black at the weakness intensity to white at strongest
